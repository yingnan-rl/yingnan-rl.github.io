I currently serve as an Assistant Professor and Master's Supervisor at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Engineering University. I graduated in 2023 from the School of Computer Science and Technology, Harbin Institute of Technology. My research focuses primarily on **Deep Reinforcement Learning**, **Intelligent Software Engineering**, and **Mobile Edge Computing**，committed to applying existing artificial intelligence technologies to practical scenarios. Contact me by email **zhaoyingnan@hrbeu.edu.cn**.
